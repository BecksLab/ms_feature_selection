| Label | Definition |
|----|----|
| Basal | Percentage of basal taxa (taxa without resources) |
| Connectance | $L/S^2$, where $S$ is the number of species and $L$ the number of links |
| Cannibal | Percentage of cannibals |
| ChLen | Mean food chain length, averaged over all species |
| ChSD | Standard deviation of ChLen |
| ChNum | log number of food chains |
| Clust | mean clustering coefficient (probability that two taxa linked to the same taxon are also linked) |
| GenSD | Normalized standard deviation of generality of a species standardized by $L/S$ |
| Herbivore | Percentage of herbivores plus detritivores (taxa that feed on basal taxa) |
| Intermediate | percentage of intermediate taxa (with both consumers and resources)LinkSD normalized standard deviation of links (number of consumers plus resources per taxon) |
| Loop | Percentage of taxa in loops (food chains in which a taxon occurs twice)L/S links per species |
| MaxSim | Mean of the maximum trophic similarity of each taxon to other taxa, the number of predators and prey shared by a pair of species divided by their total number of predators and prey |
| Omnivory | Percentage of omnivores (taxa that feed on $\geq$ 2 taxa with different trophic levels) |
| Path | characteristic path length, the mean shortest food chain length between species pairs |
| Richness | Number of trophic species, or taxa |
| TL | Short-weighted trophic level averaged across taxa |
| Top | Percentage of top taxa (taxa without consumers) |
| VulSD | Normalized standard deviation of vulnerability of a species standardized by $L/S$ |
| Links | The number of links in the network |
| Diameter | Diameter of food web, the longest shortest path between two nodes |
