  Ecological network structure is widely invoked to explain patterns of biodiversity and stability, yet decades of research have produced little consensus on which structural descriptors matter most. We argue that this apparent inconsistency arises not from methodological disagreement, but from a conceptual mismatch: network structure encodes multiple, hierarchically organised aspects of energy flow, each relating to different components of stability. Using a compilation of food webs from XXX, we quantified 31 commonly used structural metrics spanning species roles, interaction pathways, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour. We first used variable clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify dominant axes of structural variation and a non-redundant subset of descriptors. We then interpreted these axes through an energy-flow framework linking structural scale to distinct stability mechanisms: persistence (maintenance of energy flow following species loss), resistance (attenuation of perturbation propagation), and return (reorganisation of pathways following disturbance). Our analyses show that metrics often treated as competing predictors of 'stability' instead load onto different structural dimensions and relate to different stability components. Redundancy and species-role metrics primarily align with persistence, pathway and motif-based metrics with resistance, and global organisational measures with return dynamics. By explicitly mapping network structure to stability mechanisms, our results reconcile conflicting findings in the structure–stability literature and provide a principled framework for selecting network metrics based on ecological question and scale, rather than convention.

# Introduction

> Which metrics best represent the distinct stages of the energy-flow hierarchy, and do they capture different components of stability?

Ecological networks are commonly characterised using a large and diverse set of structural metrics, yet there remains little consensus on how these metrics should be interpreted or compared across studies (Vermaat et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2017). We argue that this difficulty arises because network structure is not a single property, but a hierarchy of interrelated components that encode different aspects of how energy moves through an ecosystem (Ulanowicz 1986; Thompson et al. 2012). Metrics derived at different structural scales therefore capture different ecological processes and, consequently, relate to different components of stability. Making these distinctions explicit is essential for interpreting patterns of structure–stability relationships.

### Structural scale and the organisation of energy flow

We conceptualise food-web structure as organised across four hierarchical structural scales: node-level, path-level, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour (Pimm 1982; Cohen et al. 1990; Vermaat et al. 2009). These scales reflect increasing levels of integration, progressing from individual species roles to whole-network dynamics.

**Node-level structure:** describes the properties and roles of individual species within the network. Metrics such as trophic position, basal and top species proportions, centrality, and trophic similarity capture how energy enters the system, which species process or redistribute that energy, and the degree of functional redundancy among taxa (Yodzis & Winemiller 1999; Estrada 2007; Allesina & Pascual 2009). At this scale, structure primarily reflects who participates in energy transfer and whether alternative species can compensate for local losses, a long-standing mechanism proposed to underpin persistence in complex ecosystems (McCann 2000).

**Path-level structure**: describes how energy is routed through sequences of interactions linking species. Metrics such as food chain length, omnivory, motifs, loops, and prey–predator ratios capture the coupling of energy channels and the multiplicity of pathways connecting basal resources to higher trophic levels (Pimm & Lawton 1977; McCann et al. 1998; Stouffer & Bascompte 2011). This scale reflects how energy moves through the network and how perturbations may be transmitted across species, with particular pathway configurations either amplifying or diffusing disturbance effects (Neutel et al. 2002; Rooney et al. 2006).

**Network geometry**: captures the global arrangement and constraints of interactions, including link density, connectance, clustering, modularity, intervality, and network distances (Dunne et al. 2002; Stouffer et al. 2006; Delmas et al. 2019). These properties define the overall “shape” of the food web and constrain which pathways are available for energy flow. Geometric organisation has been shown to influence the containment of perturbations, for example through compartmentalisation that limits the spread of local disturbances [@stoufferCompartmentalizationIncreasesFoodweb2011].

**Emergent system-level behaviour**: reflects the collective dynamical properties that arise from the interaction of nodes, paths, and geometry. Metrics such as spectral radius, SVD complexity, and robustness capture properties that cannot be attributed to individual species or interactions alone, but instead describe the system’s overall capacity to absorb, reorganise, or amplify perturbations (May 1972; Staniczenko et al. 2013; Strydom et al. 2021).

Together, these structural scales form a causal hierarchy: species roles give rise to interaction pathways, which are embedded within a global network geometry, from which emergent dynamical behaviour arises.

### Stability as a multi-component property

Stability is often treated as a single outcome, yet ecological theory has long recognised that it comprises multiple, distinct components (Pimm 1984; Ives & Carpenter 2007). Here, we focus on three complementary stability mechanisms that are directly interpretable in terms of energy flow: persistence, resistance, and return.

**Persistence**: refers to the continued ability of the system to sustain energy flow following species loss or disturbance. Structures that promote redundancy, multiple basal inputs, and functional overlap among species enhance persistence by ensuring that energy can continue to enter and circulate within the network even when individual components are removed (McCann 2000; Dunne et al. 2002; Jonsson et al. 2015).

**Resistance**: describes the extent to which perturbations are attenuated or contained rather than propagating through the network. Path-level structures such as omnivory, short chains, motifs, and modular organisation can diffuse or localise disturbances, reducing the likelihood that local perturbations escalate into system-wide effects (McCann et al. 1998; Neutel et al. 2002; Stouffer & Bascompte 2011).

**Return**: captures the capacity of the system to reorganise or recover following disturbance, including the re-establishment of interaction pathways and the damping of oscillations. Emergent properties linked to global organisation and heterogeneity, such as spectral radius and structural complexity, reflect constraints on system-wide dynamics and influence the speed and manner with which a system returns to equilibrium or a new stable configuration (May 1972; Ulanowicz 2001; Staniczenko et al. 2013).

Crucially, these stability components operate at different structural scales and are not expected to respond uniformly to the same network properties.

### Implications for interpreting network metrics

Within this framework, metrics that are often treated as competing predictors of 'stability' instead emerge as complementary descriptors of different stability mechanisms [@thompsonFoodWebsReconciling2012]. Node-level metrics primarily relate to persistence, path-level metrics to resistance, and global organisational metrics to return dynamics. Some descriptors span multiple scales, reflecting the coupling between structural organisation and emergent behaviour (Allesina & Tang 2012).

This perspective provides a mechanistic explanation for why studies using different network metrics frequently report contrasting structure–stability relationships. Rather than reflecting inconsistency or redundancy, these differences arise because different metrics implicitly target different components of stability [@lauEcologicalNetworkMetrics2017]. By explicitly linking structural scale, energy flow, and stability mechanism, this framework provides a principled basis for interpreting network metrics and for selecting descriptors that align with specific ecological questions.

| Structural scale | What it encodes | Energy-flow interpretation | Stability component |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Node | Species roles and redundancy | Who handles energy | Persistence (can energy still enter and move?) |
| Path | Energy routing and coupling | How energy moves | Resistance (does disturbance spread?) |
| Geometry | Network constraints and organisation | Where energy can go | Containment / buffering |
| Behaviour | Emergent dynamics | How energy reorganizes | Return / reassembly |

## Data Compilation

We compiled quantitative network data from XX, resulting in a total of XX ecological networks. Each network was characterized using a suite of XX structural metrics [@tbl-properties], including classic descriptors such as richness, connectance, and modularity, as well as information-theoretic measures like spectral radius and SVD complexity. Prior to analysis, networks with missing values were omitted, and all metrics were standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1) to account for differences in scale and units across descriptors.

## Identification of dominant structural dimensions

Ecological network metrics are frequently correlated, reflecting shared underlying structural properties. To identify dominant dimensions of food-web structure, we applied hierarchical clustering to the absolute correlation matrix of all metrics using average linkage. Cluster stability was assessed using bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations). From each stable cluster, a single representative metric was selected based on interpretability and prevalence in the literature. This procedure yielded a reduced set of descriptors capturing the primary axes of structural variation across networks.

## Linking structure to robustness

To examine how dominant structural dimensions relate to tolerance to species loss, we quantified network robustness as the proportion of secondary extinctions following primary species removal. We related robustness to both PCA scores and individual metrics from the reduced set using linear regression and Random Forest models. Random Forests were used to accommodate potential non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. Variable importance was assessed using permutation-based measures.

# Results

-   Major axes correspond to:
-   Redundancy / persistence
-   Pathway coupling / resistance
-   Organizational constraint / return
-   Reduced metric sets retain these axes

# Discussion

-   Why consensus on “the best metric” has failed
-   Why different studies find different structure–stability relationships
-   Implications for biodiversity–stability theory
-   Guidance for metric choice based on question and scale

: Network properties used for analysis. {#tbl-metrics}

To better link network structure to ecosystem function, we grouped commonly used food web metrics into four functional categories reflecting their ecological interpretation. Node-level metrics (e.g., basal, top, intermediate, herbivory, cannibal, trophic level, centrality, MaxSim) capture the roles and properties of individual species. Path-level metrics (*e.g.,* food chain lengths, motifs, omnivory, loops, prey-to-predator ratios) describe how energy and interactions flow through the network. Geometry metrics (e.g., connectance, link density, clustering, variation in links, diameter, intervality, spectral radius, SVD complexity) quantify the overall network arrangement and topological organization. Finally, behavioural/system-level metrics (e.g., robustness, spectral radius, SVD complexity) capture emergent properties such as resilience, redundancy, and dynamic stability. This framework provides a transparent, ecologically interpretable mapping from species-level roles and interaction paths to system-level behaviour, facilitates identification of a Minimum Sufficient Set of descriptors, and links network structure to long-standing questions in the stability–complexity debate.

| Category | Metrics | Rationale |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Node-level | basal, top, intermediate, herbivory, cannibal, TL, centrality, MaxSim | Metrics describing individual species and their roles in the network, including trophic position (TL), feeding type (basal, herbivory, cannibal), influence (centrality), and functional redundancy (MaxSim). |
| Path level | ChLen, ChSD, ChNum, path, S1, S2, S4, S5, omnivory, loops, predpreyRatio, distance | Metrics describing energy flow or interaction paths through the network, including food chain lengths, motifs, omnivory, loops, and prey-predator ratios. Capture how energy and interactions move across nodes. |
| Geometry/topology | connectance, l_S, links, richness, Clust, GenSD, VulSD, LinkSD, diameter, intervals | Metrics describing **overall network structure**, including density (connectance, links, L/S), size (richness), local clustering, link asymmetry, network distances (diameter), and niche structure (intervals). Capture the ‘shape’ of the network. |
| Behaviour/system-level | ρ, complexity, robustness | Metrics describing emergent properties of the network, including system-wide stability, resilience, and structural complexity. Capture how the network responds to perturbations or organizes itself at a global level. |
