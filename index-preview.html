      <meta name="citation_title" content="Multiple dimensions of network structure underlie ecological stability">
<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Ecological network structure is widely invoked to explain patterns of biodiversity and stability, yet decades of research have produced little consensus on which structural descriptors matter most. We argue that this apparent inconsistency arises not from methodological disagreement, but from a conceptual mismatch: network structure encodes multiple, hierarchically organised aspects of energy flow, each relating to different components of stability. Using a compilation of food webs from XXX, we quantified 31 commonly used structural metrics spanning species roles, interaction pathways, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour. We first used variable clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify dominant axes of structural variation and a non-redundant subset of descriptors. We then interpreted these axes through an energy-flow framework linking structural scale to distinct stability mechanisms: persistence (maintenance of energy flow following species loss), resistance (attenuation of perturbation propagation), and return (reorganisation of pathways following disturbance). Our analyses show that metrics often treated as competing predictors of &amp;amp;#039;stability' instead load onto different structural dimensions and relate to different stability components. Redundancy and species-role metrics primarily align with persistence, pathway and motif-based metrics with resistance, and global organisational measures with return dynamics. By explicitly mapping network structure to stability mechanisms, our results reconcile conflicting findings in the structure–stability literature and provide a principled framework for selecting network metrics based on ecological question and scale, rather than convention.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Spatial Guilds in the Serengeti Food Web Revealed by a Bayesian Group Model;,citation_abstract=Food webs, networks of feeding relationships in an ecosystem, provide fundamental insights into mechanisms that determine ecosystem stability and persistence. A standard approach in food-web analysis, and network analysis in general, has been to identify compartments, or modules, defined by many links within compartments and few links between them. This approach can identify large habitat boundaries in the network but may fail to identify other important structures. Empirical analyses of food webs have been further limited by low-resolution data for primary producers. In this paper, we present a Bayesian computational method for identifying group structure using a flexible definition that can describe both functional trophic roles and standard compartments. We apply this method to a newly compiled plant-mammal food web from the Serengeti ecosystem that includes high taxonomic resolution at the plant level, allowing a simultaneous examination of the signature of both habitat and trophic roles in network structure. We find that groups at the plant level reflect habitat structure, coupled at higher trophic levels by groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus the group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild structure and spatial pattern, in contrast to the standard compartments typically identified. The network topology supports recent ideas on spatial coupling and energy channels in ecosystems that have been proposed as important for persistence. Furthermore, our Bayesian approach provides a powerful, flexible framework for the study of network structure, and we believe it will prove instrumental in a variety of biological contexts.;,citation_author=Edward B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What Do Interaction Network Metrics Tell Us About Specialization and Biological Traits;,citation_abstract=The structure of ecological interaction networks is often interpreted as a product of meaningful ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape the degree of specialization in community associations. However, here we show that both unweighted network metrics (connectance, nestedness, and degree distribution) and weighted network metrics (interaction evenness, interaction strength asymmetry) are strongly constrained and biased by the number of observations. Rarely observed species are inevitably regarded as “specialists,” irrespective of their actual associations, leading to biased estimates of specialization. Consequently, a skewed distribution of species observation records (such as the lognormal), combined with a relatively low sampling density typical for ecological data, already generates a “nested” and poorly “connected” network with “asymmetric interaction strengths” when interactions are neutral. This is confirmed by null model simulations of bipartite networks, assuming that partners associate randomly in the absence of any specialization and any variation in the correspondence of biological traits between associated species (trait matching). Variation in the skewness of the frequency distribution fundamentally changes the outcome of network metrics. Therefore, interpretation of network metrics in terms of fundamental specialization and trait matching requires an appropriate control for such severe constraints imposed by information deficits. When using an alternative approach that controls for these effects, most natural networks of mutualistic or antagonistic systems show a significantly higher degree of reciprocal specialization (exclusiveness) than expected under neutral conditions. A higher exclusiveness is coherent with a tighter coevolution and suggests a lower ecological redundancy than implied by nested networks.;,citation_author=Nico Blüthgen;,citation_author=Jochen Fründ;,citation_author=Diego P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Latitudinal gradients in biotic niche breadth vary across ecosystem types;,citation_abstract=Several properties of food webs—the networks of feeding links between species—are known to vary systematically with the species richness of the underlying community. Under the ’latitude–niche breadth hypothesis’, which predicts that species in the tropics will tend to evolve narrower niches, one might expect that these scaling relationships could also be affected by latitude. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the scaling relationships between species richness and average generality, vulnerability and links per species across a set of 196 empirical food webs. In estuarine, marine and terrestrial food webs there was no effect of latitude on any scaling relationship, suggesting constant niche breadth in these habitats. In freshwater communities, on the other hand, there were strong effects of latitude on scaling relationships, supporting the latitude–niche breadth hypothesis. These contrasting findings indicate that it may be more important to account for habitat than latitude when exploring gradients in food-web structure.;,citation_author=Alyssa R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analysing ecological networks of species interactions;,citation_abstract=Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.;,citation_author=Eva Delmas;,citation_author=Mathilde Besson;,citation_author=Marie-Hélène Brice;,citation_author=Laura A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Food-web structure and network theory: The role of connectance and size;,citation_abstract=Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as “small-world” and “scale-free.” However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.;,citation_author=Jennifer A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A multitrophic perspective on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research;,citation_abstract=Concern about the functional consequences of unprecedented loss in biodiversity has prompted biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) research to become one of the most active fields of ecological research in the past 25 years. Hundreds of experiments have manipulated biodiversity as an independent variable and found compelling support that the functioning of ecosystems increases with the diversity of their ecological communities. This research has also identified some of the mechanisms underlying BEF relationships, some context-dependencies of the strength of relationships, as well as implications for various ecosystem services that mankind depends upon. In this paper, we argue that a multitrophic perspective of biotic interactions in random and non-random biodiversity change scenarios is key to advance future BEF research and to address some of its most important remaining challenges. We discuss that the study and the quantification of multitrophic interactions in space and time facilitates scaling up from small-scale biodiversity manipulations and ecosystem function assessments to management-relevant spatial scales across ecosystem boundaries. We specifically consider multitrophic conceptual frameworks to understand and predict the context-dependency of BEF relationships. Moreover, we highlight the importance of the eco-evolutionary underpinnings of multitrophic BEF relationships. We outline that FAIR data (meeting the standards of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) and reproducible processing will be key to advance this field of research by making it more integrative. Finally, we show how these BEF insights may be implemented for ecosystem management, society, and policy. Given that human well-being critically depends on the multiple services provided by diverse, multitrophic communities, integrating the approaches of evolutionary ecology, community ecology, and ecosystem ecology in future BEF research will be key to refine conservation targets and develop sustainable management strategies.;,citation_author=Nico Eisenhauer;,citation_author=Holger Schielzeth;,citation_author=Andrew D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characterization of topological keystone species;,citation_abstract=An important question in the network representation of ecological systems is to determine how direct and indirect interactions between species determine the positional importance of species in the ecosystem. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the similarities and differences of six different topological centrality measures as indicators of keystone species in 17 food webs. These indicators account for local, global and “‘meso-scale’” – intermediate between local and global – topological information about species in the food webs. Using factor analysis we shown that most of these centrality indices share a great deal of topological information, which range from 75% to 96%. A generalized keystone indicator is then proposed by considering the factor loadings of the six-centrality measures, which contains most of the information encoded by these indices. However, the individual ordering of species according to these criteria display significant differences in most food webs. We simulate the effects of species extinction by removing species ranked according to a local and a “‘meso-scale’” centrality indicator. The differences observed on three network characteristics – size, average distance and clustering coefficient of the largest component –after the removal of the most central nodes indicate that the consideration of these indices have different impacts for the ranking of species with conservational biology purposes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Network Centrality Measures to Manage Landscape Connectivity;,citation_abstract=We use a graph-theoretical landscape modeling approach to investigate how to identify central patches in the landscape as well as how these central patches influence (1) organism movement within the local neighborhood and (2) the dispersal of organisms beyond the local neighborhood. Organism movements were theoretically estimated based on the spatial configuration of the habitat patches in the studied landscape. We find that centrality depends on the way the graph-theoretical model of habitat patches is constructed, although even the simplest network representation, not taking strength and directionality of potential organisms flows into account, still provides a coarse-grained assessment of the most important patches according to their contribution to landscape connectivity. Moreover, we identify (at least) two general classes of centrality. One accounts for the local flow of organisms in the neighborhood of a patch, and the other accounts for the ability to maintain connectivity beyond the scale of the local neighborhood. Finally, we study how habitat patches with high scores on different network centrality measures are distributed in a fragmented agricultural landscape in Madagascar. Results show that patches with high degree and betweenness centrality are widely spread, while patches with high subgraph and closeness centrality are clumped together in dense clusters.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The meaning of functional trait composition of food webs for ecosystem functioning;,citation_abstract=There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the everincreasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interprétable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and topdown control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.;,citation_author=Dominique Gravel;,citation_author=Camille Albouy;,citation_author=Wilfried Thuiller;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24768743;,citation_issue=1694;,citation_issn=0962-8436;,citation_volume=371;,citation_journal_title=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences;,citation_publisher=Royal Society;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards an Integration of Biodiversity–Ecosystem Functioning and Food Web Theory to Evaluate Relationships between Multiple Ecosystem Services;,citation_abstract=Ecosystem responses to changes in species diversity are often studied individually. However, changes in species diversity can simultaneously influence multiple interdependent ecosystem functions. Therefore, an important challenge is to determine when and how changes in species diversity that influence one function will also drive changes in other functions. By providing the underlying structure of species interactions, ecological networks can quantify connections between biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Here, we review parallels in the conceptual development of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) and food web theory (FWT) research. Subsequently, we evaluate three common principles that unite these two research areas by explaining the patterns, concentrations, and direction of the flux of nutrients and energy through the species in diverse interaction webs. We give examples of combined BEF–FWT approaches that can be used to identify vulnerable species and habitats and to evaluate links that drive trade-offs between multiple ecosystems functions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems;,citation_abstract=Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The reliability of R50 as a measure of vulnerability of food webs to sequential species deletions;,citation_abstract=Recent studies predict elevated and accelerating rates of species extinctions over the 21st century, due to climate change and habitat loss. Considering that such primary species loss may initiate cascades of secondary extinctions and push systems towards critical tipping points, we urgently need to increase our understanding of if certain sequences of species extinctions can be expected to be more devastating than others Most theoretical studies addressing this question have used a topological (non-dynamical) approach to analyse the probability that food webs will collapse, below a fixed threshold value in species richness, when subjected to different sequences of species loss. Typically, these studies have neither considered the possibility of dynamical responses of species, nor that conclusions may depend on the value of the collapse threshold. Here we analyse how sensitive conclusions on the importance of different species are to the threshold value of food web collapse. Using dynamical simulations, where we expose model food webs to a range of extinction sequences, we evaluate the reliability of the most frequently used index, R50, as a measure of food web robustness. In general, we find that R50 is a reliable measure and that identification of destructive deletion sequences is fairly robust, within a moderate range of collapse thresholds. At the same time, however, focusing on R50 only hides a lot of interesting information on the disassembly process and can, in some cases, lead to incorrect conclusions on the relative importance of species in food webs.;,citation_author=Tomas Jonsson;,citation_author=Sofia Berg;,citation_author=Alexander Pimenov;,citation_author=Catherine Palmer;,citation_author=Mark Emmerson;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.01588;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/oik.01588;,citation_issn=1600-0706;,citation_volume=124;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Oikos;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Synthesising the Relationships Between Food Web Structure and Robustness;,citation_abstract=For many decades, ecologists have sought to understand the extent to which species losses lead to secondary extinctions—that is, the additional loss of species that occurs when resources or key interactions are lost (i.e. robustness). In particular, ecologists aim to identify generalisable rules that explain which types of food webs are more or less robust to secondary extinctions. Food web structure, or the patterns formed by species and their interactions, has been extensively studied as a potential factor that influences robustness to species loss. We systematically reviewed 28 studies to identify the relationships between food web structure and robustness to species loss and how the conclusions depend on methodological differences. Contrary to popular belief and theory, we found relatively consistent, positive relationships between connectance and robustness, among other generalities. Yet, we also found that conflicting conclusions about structure-robustness relationships can be, in part, attributed to differences in the type of data that studies use, particularly studies that use empirical data versus those generated from theoretical models.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Food-web structure varies along environmental gradients in a high-latitude marine ecosystem;,citation_abstract=Large-scale patterns in species diversity and community composition are associated with environmental gradients, but the implications of these patterns for food-web structure are still unclear. Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food-web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food-web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food-web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food-web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food-web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food-web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food-web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However, the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food-web structure, implying that interacting species may co-vary in space. In conclusion, our study shows how environmental heterogeneity, via environmental filtering, influences not only turnover in species composition, but also the structure of food webs over large spatial scales.;,citation_author=Susanne Kortsch;,citation_author=Raul Primicerio;,citation_author=Michaela Aschan;,citation_author=Sigrid Lind;,citation_author=Andrey V.

Species extinction is happening at faster rates than ever, greatly exceeding the five mass extinctions in the fossil record. Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement.

Simple structural models produce gradient, compartmented or nested patterns of interaction; intermediate patterns between a gradient and compartments are possible, and nesting within compartments produces a combined model. Interaction patterns can be visualized and analyzed either as matrices, as bipartite networks or as multivariate sets through correspondence analysis. We argue that differences among patterns represent outcomes of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes in these highly diversified assemblages. Instead of choosing one model a priori, assemblages should be probed for a suite of patterns. A plant–pollinator assemblage exemplifies a simple nested pattern, whereas a plant–herbivore assemblage illustrates a compound pattern with nested structures within compartments. Compartmentation should reflect coevolutionary histories and constraints, whereas differences in species abundance or dispersal may generate nestedness.;,citation_author=Thomas M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Geographical variation of multiplex ecological networks in marine intertidal communities;,citation_abstract=Understanding the drivers of geographical variation in species distributions, and the resulting community structure, constitutes one of the grandest challenges in ecology. Geographical patterns of species richness and composition have been relatively well studied. Less is known about how the entire set of trophic and non-trophic ecological interactions, and the complex networks that they create by gluing species together in complex communities, change across geographical extents. Here, we compiled data of species composition and three types of ecological interactions occurring between species in rocky intertidal communities across a large spatial extent (~970 km of shoreline) of central Chile, and analyzed the geographical variability in these multiplex networks (i.e., comprising several interaction types) of ecological interactions. We calculated nine network summary statistics common across interaction types, and additional network attributes specific to each of the different types of interactions. We then investigated potential environmental drivers of this multivariate network organization. These included variation in sea surface temperature and coastal upwelling, the main drivers of productivity in nearshore waters. Our results suggest that structural properties of multiplex ecological networks are affected by local species richness and modulated by factors influencing productivity and environmental predictability. Our results show that non-trophic negative interactions are more sensitive to spatially structured temporal environmental variation than feeding relationships, with non-trophic positive interactions being the least labile to it. We also show that environmental effects are partly mediated through changes in species richness and partly through direct influences on species interactions, probably associated to changes in environmental predictability and to bottom-up nutrient availability.

For centuries, ecologists have charted these stories to better understand phenomena such as pollination and disease. We have been using the lens of network science to distill them into topological patterns such as nestedness or modularity. Yet, like in the old buddhist parable of the blind monks and the elephant, these separate views have often missed the bigger picture. In this Perspective, we review the history of topological studies of interaction networks, challenge the “black-and-white” paradigm, and point out a way forward: the Integrative Theory of Interaction Networks (ITIN). This theory unveils the logic of how interaction networks assemble through sequential, rule-bound processes shaped mainly by resource dissimilarity and interaction type. We show that compound topologies are likely the norm in function-oriented, taxonomically-inclusive, well-sampled networks. ITIN is deductive, predictive, and testable, mapping from first principles to real-world systems, thus helping us grasp “the whole elephant”.

We show that in real food webs, interaction strengths are organized in trophic loops in such a way that long loops contain relatively many weak links. We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum “loop weight” and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring the temporal variability of a food web using long-term biomonitoring data;,citation_abstract=Ecological communities are constantly being reshaped in the face of environmental change and anthropogenic pressures. Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade-off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long-term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, “node-weighted” food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node-weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.;,citation_author=Pierre Olivier;,citation_author=Romain Frelat;,citation_author=Erik Bonsdorff;,citation_author=Susanne Kortsch;,citation_author=Ingrid Kröncke;,citation_author=Christian Möllmann;,citation_author=Hermann Neumann;,citation_author=Anne F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The structure of probabilistic networks;,citation_abstract=There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Compartmentalization increases food-web persistence;,citation_abstract=It has recently been noted that empirical food webs are significantly compartmentalized; that is, subsets of species exist that interact more frequently among themselves than with other species in the community. Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.;,citation_author=Daniel B.

The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web “motifs” which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Scaling from Metawebs to Realised Webs: A Hierarchical Approach to Network Ecology;,citation_abstract=Ecological networks provide a critical framework for understanding the architecture of biodiversity and predicting ecosystem responses to environmental change. However, the application of network ecology is often hindered by a lack of clarity regarding the assumptions inherent in different network representations. Here, we present a hierarchical framework that distinguishes between “metawebs” (representing the fundamental feasibility of interactions) and “realised webs” (representing interactions expressed in specific spatiotemporal contexts). We contrast our conceptual approach with recent data-centric reviews, focusing instead on the theoretical gradients that govern network construction. We identify five core processes that drive the transition from potential to realised interactions: evolutionary compatibility and co-occurrence, which define the feasibility of links; and abundance, diet choice, and non-trophic interactions, which determine their realisation. Furthermore, we map these processes onto a methodological spectrum of network construction, distinguishing between inductive approaches (*e.g.,* trait-matching and stochastic models) that infer structure from observation, and deductive approaches (*e.g.,* neutral and optimal foraging models) that generate structure from mechanistic first principles. By making explicit the assumptions and scale-dependent processes underpinning these different representations, this framework clarifies the scope of inference possible with each approach, ultimately facilitating more robust predictions of biodiversity dynamics in the anthropocene.;,citation_author=Tanya Strydom;,citation_author=Alexander M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=SVD Entropy Reveals the High Complexity of Ecological Networks;,citation_abstract=Quantifying the complexity of ecological networks has remained elusive. Primarily, complexity has been defined on the basis of the structural (or behavioural) complexity of the system. These definitions ignore the notion of ’physical complexity’, which can measure the amount of information contained in an ecological network, and how difficult it would be to compress. We present relative rank deficiency and SVD entropy as measures of ’external’ and ’internal’ complexity respectively. Using bipartite ecological networks, we find that they all show a very high, almost maximal, physical complexity. Pollination networks, in particular, are more complex when compared to other types of interactions. In addition, we find that SVD entropy relates to other structural measures of complexity (nestedness, connectance, and spectral radius), but does not inform about the resilience of a network when using simulated extinction cascades, which has previously been reported for structural measures of complexity. We argue that SVD entropy provides a fundamentally more ’correct’ measure of network complexity and should be added to the toolkit of descriptors of ecological networks moving forward.;,citation_author=Tanya Strydom;,citation_author=Giulio V.

A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures.

This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Limits to Trophic Levels and Omnivory in Complex Food Webs: Theory and Data;,citation_abstract=While trophic levels have found broad application throughout ecology, they are also in much contention on analytical and empirical grounds. Here, we use a new generation of data and theory to examine long-standing questions about trophic-level limits and degrees of omnivory. The data include food webs of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A., the island of Saint Martin, a U.K. grassland, and a Florida seagrass community, which appear to be the most trophically complete food webs available in the primary literature due to their inclusion of autotrophs and empirically derived estimates of the relative energetic contributions of each trophic link. We show that most (54%) of the 212 species in the four food webs can be unambiguously assigned to a discrete trophic level. Omnivory among the remaining species appears to be quite limited, as judged by the standard deviation of omnivores’ energy-weighted food-chain lengths. This allows simple algorithms based on binary food webs without energetic details to yield surprisingly accurate estimates of species’ trophic and omnivory levels. While maximum trophic levels may plausibly exceed historically asserted limits, our analyses contradict both recent empirical claims that these limits are exceeded and recent theoretical claims that rampant omnivory eliminates the scientific utility of the trophic-level concept.;,citation_author=Richard J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Success and its limits among structural models of complex food webs;,citation_abstract=1. Following the development of the relatively successful niche model, several other simple structural food web models have been proposed. These models predict the detailed structure of complex food webs given only two input parameters, the numbers of species and the number of feeding links among them. 2. The models claim different degrees of success but have not been compared consistently with each other or with the empirical data. We compared the performance of five structural models rigorously against 10 empirical food webs from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats containing 25-92 species and 68-997 links. 3. All models include near-hierarchical ordering of species’ consumption and have identical distributions of the number of prey of each consumer species, but differ in the extent to which species’ diets are required to be contiguous and the rules used to assign feeding links. 4. The models perform similarly on a range of food-web properties, including the fraction of top, intermediate and basal species, the standard deviations of generality and connectivity and the fraction of herbivores and omnivores. 5. For other properties, including the standard deviation of vulnerability, the fraction of cannibals and species in loops, mean trophic level, path length, clustering coefficient, maximum similarity and diet discontinuity, there are significant differences in the performance of the different models. 6. While the empirical data do not support the niche model’s assumption of diet contiguity, models which relax this assumption all have worse overall performance than the niche model.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Linking structure and function in food webs: Maximization of different ecological functions generates distinct food web structures;,citation_abstract=1. Trophic interactions are central to ecosystem functioning, but the link between food web structure and ecosystem functioning remains obscure. Regularities (i.e. consistent patterns) in food web structure suggest the possibility of regularities in ecosystem functioning, which might be used to relate structure to function. 2. We introduce a novel, genetic algorithm approach to simulate food webs with maximized throughput (a proxy for ecosystem functioning) and compare the structure of these simulated food webs to real empirical food webs using common metrics of food web structure. We repeat this analysis using robustness to secondary extinctions (a proxy for ecosystem resilience) instead of throughput to determine the relative contributions of ecosystem functioning and ecosystem resilience to food web structure. 3. Simulated food webs that maximized robustness were similar to real food webs when connectance (i.e. levels of interaction across the food web) was high, but this result did not extend to food webs with low connectance. Simulated food webs that maximized throughput or a combination of throughput and robustness were not similar to any real food webs. 4. Simulated maximum-throughput food webs differed markedly from maximum-robustness food webs, which suggests that maximizing different ecological functions can generate distinct food web structures. Based on our results, food web structure would appear to have a stronger relationship with ecosystem resilience than with ecosystem throughput. 5. Our genetic algorithm approach is general and is well suited to large, realistically complex food webs. Genetic algorithms can incorporate constraints on structure and can generate outputs that can be compared directly to empirical data. Our method can be used to explore a range of maximization or minimization hypotheses, providing new perspectives on the links between structure and function in ecological systems.;,citation_author=Jian D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In Search of Operational Trophospecies in a Tropical Aquatic Food Web;,citation_abstract=Aggregations of biological species on the basis of trophic similarity (trophospecies) are the basic units of study in food web and ecosystem research, yet little attention has been devoted to articulating objective protocols for defining such aggregations. This study formulates several possible definitions based on alternative measures of similarity and hierarchical clustering. Twenty-four alternative methods were applied to a food web consisting of 116 original trophic entities (OTEs) from a tropical floodplain, for which the relative magnitude of each trophic link was estimated based on dietary data measured as volumetric proportions. The resulting 24 trophic hierarchies were compared based on cophenetic correlation and matrices of OTE pairwise similarity, and patterns were interpreted based on additional ecological analyses for this system. Similarity measures based on topological food web (presence/absence) data yielded slightly greater cophenetic correlations than did measures based on dietary proportions (flow webs), but, overall, OTE pairwise correlations were not greater for one method relative to the other. The difference between these two approaches is driven by the treatment of weak feeding links; at least for the system considered here, distinctions among dietary generalists were obscured when weak links were weighted lightly. Additively combining the predator and resource aspects of each OTE’s trophic role performed better than combining them multiplicatively. In general, there was little correspondence between OTE overlap in resource use and the extent to which predators were shared. Two measures of cluster similarity, one designed by us specifically for food webs (maximum linkage) and the other a standard method (average similarity between clusters), yielded more consistent and ecologically interpretable patterns of aggregation than other measures of cluster similarity considered. In deciding whether two trophospecies should be assigned a trophic link, the maximum linkage convention (in which a link is included if any pair of OTEs, one in each trophospecies, are linked) produced more aggregation than the minimum linkage convention (in which a link is included only if every pair of OTEs, pair members in each of the two trophospecies, is linked). The choice of similarity level for defining trophospecies remained an unresolved issue based on our analysis of this dataset. Perhaps the greatest challenge is posed by sampling bias within empirical datasets, and we ultimately conclude that it is difficult to identify trophospecies in this dataset by strictly objective criteria.;,citation_author=Peter Yodzis;,citation_author=Kirk O.

        <p>Ecological network structure is widely invoked to explain patterns of biodiversity and stability, yet decades of research have produced little consensus on which structural descriptors matter most. We argue that this apparent inconsistency arises not from methodological disagreement, but from a conceptual mismatch: network structure encodes multiple, hierarchically organised aspects of energy flow, each relating to different components of stability. Using a compilation of food webs from XXX, we quantified 31 commonly used structural metrics spanning species roles, interaction pathways, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour. We first used variable clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify dominant axes of structural variation and a non-redundant subset of descriptors. We then interpreted these axes through an energy-flow framework linking structural scale to distinct stability mechanisms: persistence (maintenance of energy flow following species loss), resistance (attenuation of perturbation propagation), and return (reorganisation of pathways following disturbance). Our analyses show that metrics often treated as competing predictors of ‘stability’ instead load onto different structural dimensions and relate to different stability components. Redundancy and species-role metrics primarily align with persistence, pathway and motif-based metrics with resistance, and global organisational measures with return dynamics. By explicitly mapping network structure to stability mechanisms, our results reconcile conflicting findings in the structure–stability literature and provide a principled framework for selecting network metrics based on ecological question and scale, rather than convention.</p>

<p>Which metrics best represent the distinct stages of the energy-flow hierarchy, and do they capture different components of stability?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ecological networks are commonly characterised using a large and diverse set of structural metrics, yet there remains little consensus on how these metrics should be interpreted or compared across studies (Vermaat et al.&nbsp;2009; Lau et al.&nbsp;2017). We argue that this difficulty arises because network structure is not a single property, but a hierarchy of interrelated components that encode different aspects of how energy moves through an ecosystem (Ulanowicz 1986; Thompson et al.&nbsp;2012). Metrics derived at different structural scales therefore capture different ecological processes and, consequently, relate to different components of stability. Making these distinctions explicit is essential for interpreting patterns of structure–stability relationships.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.0.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structural-scale-and-the-organisation-of-energy-flow"><span class="header-section-number">1.0.1</span> Structural scale and the organisation of energy flow</h3>
<p>We conceptualise food-web structure as organised across four hierarchical structural scales: node-level, path-level, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour (Pimm 1982; Cohen et al.&nbsp;1990; Vermaat et al.&nbsp;2009). These scales reflect increasing levels of integration, progressing from individual species roles to whole-network dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Node-level structure:</strong> describes the properties and roles of individual species within the network. Metrics such as trophic position, basal and top species proportions, centrality, and trophic similarity capture how energy enters the system, which species process or redistribute that energy, and the degree of functional redundancy among taxa (Yodzis &amp; Winemiller 1999; Estrada 2007; Allesina &amp; Pascual 2009). At this scale, structure primarily reflects who participates in energy transfer and whether alternative species can compensate for local losses, a long-standing mechanism proposed to underpin persistence in complex ecosystems (McCann 2000).</p>
<p><strong>Path-level structure</strong>: describes how energy is routed through sequences of interactions linking species. Metrics such as food chain length, omnivory, motifs, loops, and prey–predator ratios capture the coupling of energy channels and the multiplicity of pathways connecting basal resources to higher trophic levels (Pimm &amp; Lawton 1977; McCann et al.&nbsp;1998; Stouffer &amp; Bascompte 2011). This scale reflects how energy moves through the network and how perturbations may be transmitted across species, with particular pathway configurations either amplifying or diffusing disturbance effects (Neutel et al.&nbsp;2002; Rooney et al.&nbsp;2006).</p>
<p><strong>Network geometry</strong>: captures the global arrangement and constraints of interactions, including link density, connectance, clustering, modularity, intervality, and network distances (Dunne et al.&nbsp;2002; Stouffer et al.&nbsp;2006; Delmas et al.&nbsp;2019). These properties define the overall “shape” of the food web and constrain which pathways are available for energy flow. Geometric organisation has been shown to influence the containment of perturbations, for example through compartmentalisation that limits the spread of local disturbances <span class="citation" data-cites="stoufferCompartmentalizationIncreasesFoodweb2011">(<a href="#ref-stoufferCompartmentalizationIncreasesFoodweb2011" role="doc-biblioref">Stouffer and Bascompte 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Emergent system-level behaviour</strong>: reflects the collective dynamical properties that arise from the interaction of nodes, paths, and geometry. Metrics such as spectral radius, SVD complexity, and robustness capture properties that cannot be attributed to individual species or interactions alone, but instead describe the system’s overall capacity to absorb, reorganise, or amplify perturbations (May 1972; Staniczenko et al.&nbsp;2013; Strydom et al.&nbsp;2021).</p>
<p>Together, these structural scales form a causal hierarchy: species roles give rise to interaction pathways, which are embedded within a global network geometry, from which emergent dynamical behaviour arises.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stability-as-a-multi-component-property"><span class="header-section-number">1.0.2</span> Stability as a multi-component property</h3>
<p>Stability is often treated as a single outcome, yet ecological theory has long recognised that it comprises multiple, distinct components (Pimm 1984; Ives &amp; Carpenter 2007). Here, we focus on three complementary stability mechanisms that are directly interpretable in terms of energy flow: persistence, resistance, and return.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence</strong>: refers to the continued ability of the system to sustain energy flow following species loss or disturbance. Structures that promote redundancy, multiple basal inputs, and functional overlap among species enhance persistence by ensuring that energy can continue to enter and circulate within the network even when individual components are removed (McCann 2000; Dunne et al.&nbsp;2002; Jonsson et al.&nbsp;2015).</p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong>: describes the extent to which perturbations are attenuated or contained rather than propagating through the network. Path-level structures such as omnivory, short chains, motifs, and modular organisation can diffuse or localise disturbances, reducing the likelihood that local perturbations escalate into system-wide effects (McCann et al.&nbsp;1998; Neutel et al.&nbsp;2002; Stouffer &amp; Bascompte 2011).</p>
<p><strong>Return</strong>: captures the capacity of the system to reorganise or recover following disturbance, including the re-establishment of interaction pathways and the damping of oscillations. Emergent properties linked to global organisation and heterogeneity, such as spectral radius and structural complexity, reflect constraints on system-wide dynamics and influence the speed and manner with which a system returns to equilibrium or a new stable configuration (May 1972; Ulanowicz 2001; Staniczenko et al.&nbsp;2013).</p>
<p>Crucially, these stability components operate at different structural scales and are not expected to respond uniformly to the same network properties.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-interpreting-network-metrics"><span class="header-section-number">1.0.3</span> Implications for interpreting network metrics</h3>
<p>Within this framework, metrics that are often treated as competing predictors of ‘stability’ instead emerge as complementary descriptors of different stability mechanisms <span class="citation" data-cites="thompsonFoodWebsReconciling2012">(<a href="#ref-thompsonFoodWebsReconciling2012" role="doc-biblioref">Thompson et al. 2012</a>)</span>. Node-level metrics primarily relate to persistence, path-level metrics to resistance, and global organisational metrics to return dynamics. Some descriptors span multiple scales, reflecting the coupling between structural organisation and emergent behaviour (Allesina &amp; Tang 2012).</p>
<p>This perspective provides a mechanistic explanation for why studies using different network metrics frequently report contrasting structure–stability relationships. Rather than reflecting inconsistency or redundancy, these differences arise because different metrics implicitly target different components of stability <span class="citation" data-cites="lauEcologicalNetworkMetrics2017">(<a href="#ref-lauEcologicalNetworkMetrics2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lau et al. 2017</a>)</span>. By explicitly linking structural scale, energy flow, and stability mechanism, this framework provides a principled basis for interpreting network metrics and for selecting descriptors that align with specific ecological questions.</p>

<p>To identify the dominant axes of structural variation within our dataset, we expanded upon the dimensionality reduction approach established by Vermaat et al.&nbsp;(2009). We quantified 31 structural metrics for each food web, categorising them into four hierarchical scales of energy flow: Node-level (e.g., trophic roles), Path-level (e.g., energy sequences), Network Geometry (e.g., global shape), and Emergent Behaviour (e.g., system-wide complexity).</p>

<p>To identify a non-redundant subset of structural descriptors, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the scaled structural metrics. We excluded stability-related outcomes (<em>e.g.,</em> robustness, ρ, and SVD complexity) from the PCA to ensure the resulting dimensions represented pure physical architecture.</p>
<p>We determined the number of significant structural dimensions using Kaiser’s Criterion (eigenvalues &gt;1) and an analysis of the scree plot ‘elbow’. To select a representative anchor for each significant dimension, we programmatically identified the metric with the highest contribution percentage (cos^2) to each Principal Component (PC). In cases where a single metric dominated multiple dimensions, the next highest unique contributor was selected to ensure a parsimonious yet comprehensive subset of predictors.</p>

<p>To determine the optimal number of structural modules, we calculated Average Silhouette Widths for k=2 to 10.

<p>The PCA revealed a high-dimensional structural space where the first six principal components accounted for 84.9% of the total structural variation (Table 1). This indicates that while food web structure is complex, it can be effectively distilled into six primary axes of architectural variation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimension 1 (31.6% variance) was anchored by S1 (the number of pathways from basal species), representing the total volume of energy entry points.</li>
<li>Dimension 2 (21.6% variance) was dominated by Richness (S), representing the overall scale of the network.</li>
<li>Dimension 3 (15.5% variance) was defined by the Predator-Prey Ratio, capturing the balance of trophic roles (Node-level).</li>
<li>Dimension 4 (6.8% variance) was driven by Mean Distance, reflecting the efficiency or tightness of the wiring (Path-level).</li>
<li>Dimension 5 (5.2% variance) was anchored by Herbivory, identifying the functional dominance of specific energy channels.</li>
<li>Dimension 6 (4.4% variance) was represented by MaxSim (Maximum Similarity), a measure of trophic redundancy and functional overlap.</li>

<p>The distribution of these representative metrics across the PCA dimensions suggests that no single hierarchical scale dominates food-web variation. Instead, the network space is composed of a mixture of Path-level (S1, Distance), Geometry (Richness), and Node-level (PredPreyRatio, Herbivory, MaxSim) properties. Notably, S1 (a Path-level metric) explained more variance than Richness, suggesting that the arrangement of energy flow pathways is a more fundamental structural signature than simple species counts.</p>

<p>The Random Forest models revealed a clear partitioning of structural influence, with different ‘pillars’ emerging as the dominant predictors for each stability component (Table 2).</p>
<p>Persistence (Robustness) was primarily governed by PredPreyRatio (%IncMSE = 15.98) and Herbivory (%IncMSE = 10.23). Surprisingly, network Richness had no predictive power for persistence (%IncMSE = -2.49), suggesting that the balance of trophic roles is more critical for preventing extinction cascades than the total number of species.</p>
<p>Dampening (ρ) was most sensitive to Herbivory (%IncMSE = 17.28). This indicates that the strength and proportion of energy flow originating from the basal-consumer interface is the primary regulator of a network’s local stability.</p>
<p>Organization (SVD Complexity) was uniquely driven by MaxSim (%IncMSE = 13.12) and S1 (%IncMSE = 12.56). This supports the view that informational complexity emerges from a combination of unique species roles (low similarity) and the total volume of energy entry pathways.</p>

<p>Partial dependence analysis provided a mechanistic look at how these pillars operate:</p>
<p>Trophic Balance: Persistence showed a [direction] response to the PredPreyRatio, indicating an optimal balance between consumers and resources is required to maintain structural integrity.</p>
<p>Basal Channels: The system’s ability to dampen perturbations (ρ) improved as Herbivory [increased/decreased], suggesting that basal-heavy webs act as a buffer for energy surges.</p>
<p>Specialization: SVD Complexity increased as MaxSim decreased, confirming that organised networks are those where species occupy distinct, non-overlapping trophic niches rather than redundant ones.</p>
<p>Our multi-stage analysis reveals that food web stability is governed by a hierarchical architecture where structural modules serve as specialized functional levers. While Principal Component Analysis and Silhouette validation (k=10) confirm the high dimensionality of network space, the hierarchical clustering identifies four robust, independent modules (AU ≥ 0.94) that dictate system behaviour. We find a clear decoupling of network scale from network persistence; specifically, the Geometric Scale module (containing Richness and Connectance) accounts for significant structural variance but fails to predict any component of stability. Instead, the Energy Flow Engine (Module 3) and Trophic Redundancy (Module 4) emerge as the primary controllers. Specifically, node-level balance within the flow engine (PredPreyRatio and Herbivory) determines persistence and dampening, while the isolation of species roles (MaxSim) dictates organizational complexity. This suggests that the stability of an ecosystem is not a product of its size, but of the specific configuration of its energy channels and the redundancy of its functional roles.</p>

<p>For more than four decades, the structure–stability debate has oscillated between competing structural descriptors, from connectance and complexity to modularity, omnivory, and trophic redundancy. Early theoretical work, most notably by May, suggested that increasing complexity should destabilise large systems, placing global descriptors such as connectance and interaction density at the centre of the debate. Subsequent empirical and theoretical studies, however, demonstrated stabilising roles for omnivory, weak links, and compartmentalisation (e.g.&nbsp;McCann; Dunne), shifting attention toward pathway-level and geometric properties. Our results suggest that this apparent inconsistency does not arise because some metrics are “wrong,” but because they capture different dimensions of a fundamentally multi-layered architecture. Food-web structure is not a single axis ranging from simple to complex; it is a high-dimensional space in which node composition, pathway routing, geometric constraint, and emergent organisation vary semi-independently. Metrics that have historically been treated as competitors—such as richness, connectance, omnivory, and redundancy—are in fact anchors of distinct structural dimensions. This explains why no single metric consistently predicts “stability” across studies: stability itself is not singular. When studies measure persistence (e.g.&nbsp;secondary extinctions), node-level balance and redundancy dominate. When they measure local stability or damping, path-level coupling and basal channel dominance matter more. When they measure recovery or informational organisation, global heterogeneity and role differentiation become decisive. The search for a universal structural predictor of stability has therefore been misguided—not because structure is unimportant, but because both structure and stability are multidimensional.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reconciling-contrasting-structurestability-relationships"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Reconciling contrasting structure–stability relationships</h2>
<p>A persistent challenge in the literature has been that similar metrics sometimes show opposite associations with stability. For example, omnivory has been reported as stabilising in some contexts and destabilising in others. Within our framework, this variability is expected. Path-level coupling (e.g.&nbsp;omnivory motifs) primarily relates to resistance—the containment or diffusion of perturbations—rather than persistence per se. A structure that dampens oscillations may not prevent extinction cascades, and vice versa. Similarly, our finding that richness contributes substantially to structural variance but fails to predict any stability component underscores an important decoupling: network size is not synonymous with robustness. This result aligns with empirical syntheses showing that species richness alone poorly predicts secondary extinction resistance unless accompanied by trophic balance or redundancy. In our analyses, the predator–prey ratio and herbivory—metrics reflecting trophic shape and basal channel dominance—were far stronger determinants of persistence and damping than richness itself. This helps reconcile why biodiversity–stability studies sometimes find positive, neutral, or context-dependent relationships. Richness operates primarily as a geometric scaling variable. Its effect on stability depends on how additional species alter the configuration of energy channels—whether they add redundancy, elongate chains, skew trophic balance, or increase coupling. Without specifying which structural dimension richness modifies, its stability effect is indeterminate.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-biodiversitystability-theory"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Implications for biodiversity–stability theory</h2>
<p>Our results contribute to a long-standing tension between the “complexity begets instability” argument and more recent views that diversity enhances resilience. The resolution lies in recognising that different dimensions of complexity influence different stability components. Redundancy and trophic similarity (low MaxSim heterogeneity) enhance persistence by providing functional compensation following species loss. Pathway multiplicity and basal channel dominance regulate resistance by shaping how perturbations propagate. Global organisational heterogeneity (captured by SVD complexity and spectral properties) influences return dynamics by constraining system-wide oscillations and reassembly patterns. In this sense, complexity is neither inherently stabilising nor destabilising. Instead, distinct forms of complexity map onto distinct dynamical outcomes. Connectance, motif structure, redundancy, and informational heterogeneity are not interchangeable proxies for “complexity,” but structurally and mechanistically distinct attributes. By explicitly embedding food-web metrics within an energy-flow hierarchy, our framework reframes biodiversity–stability theory. Stability emerges not from species number alone, but from the configuration of energy channels and the distribution of functional roles across those channels. A bottom-heavy web with balanced predator–prey ratios and differentiated trophic niches may achieve both persistence and damping, even at moderate richness. Conversely, a species-rich but top-heavy or weakly differentiated web may remain fragile.</p>

<p>A key practical outcome of our analysis is the identification of six structural pillars that capture nearly 85% of the variation in network architecture. Despite starting with 31 commonly used metrics, much of their variance collapses into a smaller number of independent axes. Hierarchical clustering further revealed robust modules corresponding to trophic balance, pathway structure, geometric scale, and redundancy. This dimensional reduction has two important implications. First, it demonstrates that many commonly reported metrics are statistically redundant. Reporting both connectance and L/S, or multiple correlated distance measures, adds little new information. Second, it provides a principled route toward a minimum sufficient descriptor set tailored to ecological questions. Rather than selecting metrics by convention, researchers can select representatives of the relevant structural scale.</p>

<p>If the question concerns extinction cascades or tolerance to species loss (persistence): prioritise node-level balance and redundancy metrics (e.g.&nbsp;predator–prey ratio, herbivory, similarity). If the question concerns perturbation propagation or damping (resistance): focus on path-level and basal-channel metrics (e.g.&nbsp;pathway multiplicity, omnivory, mean distance). If the question concerns recovery dynamics or organisational reassembly (return): emphasise global heterogeneity and spectral measures (e.g.&nbsp;SVD complexity, spectral radius). If the question concerns comparative architecture across systems: use geometric anchors (e.g.&nbsp;richness) but interpret them as scale descriptors rather than stability predictors. This scale-explicit approach shifts the emphasis from asking “Which metric best predicts stability?” to “Which structural dimension corresponds to the stability mechanism of interest?”</p>

<p>While our framework clarifies structural dimensionality, it remains grounded in static network topology. Real ecosystems exhibit interaction strengths, temporal variability, adaptive rewiring, and environmental forcing. Incorporating weighted networks and dynamic simulations would strengthen the mechanistic link between structural axes and realised dynamics. Additionally, the separation of persistence, resistance, and return is analytically useful but biologically intertwined. For example, structures that enhance resistance may indirectly support persistence by preventing large cascades. Future work could explore how these components interact across environmental gradients and disturbance regimes. Finally, extending this framework beyond trophic networks to mutualistic, host–parasite, or multilayer networks would test its generality. The energy-flow hierarchy proposed here may represent a broader organising principle of ecological interaction systems.</p>

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Food-web stability is not governed by a single structural property, but by multiple, hierarchically organised dimensions of network architecture. Node composition, pathway routing, geometric constraint, and emergent organisation each represent distinct levers through which ecosystems maintain persistence, resist perturbation, and reorganise following disturbance.</p>
<p>By explicitly mapping structural scale to stability mechanism, we reconcile decades of seemingly conflicting findings in the structure–stability literature. The key insight is not that one metric is superior, but that different metrics answer different ecological questions. Recognising and embracing this multidimensionality provides a coherent foundation for future biodiversity–stability research and a practical framework for selecting network descriptors based on mechanism rather than tradition.</p>

<p>To better link network structure to ecosystem function, we grouped commonly used food web metrics into four functional categories reflecting their ecological interpretation. Node-level metrics (e.g., basal, top, intermediate, herbivory, cannibal, trophic level, centrality, MaxSim) capture the roles and properties of individual species. Path-level metrics (<em>e.g.,</em> food chain lengths, motifs, omnivory, loops, prey-to-predator ratios) describe how energy and interactions flow through the network. Geometry metrics (e.g., connectance, link density, clustering, variation in links, diameter, intervality, spectral radius, SVD complexity) quantify the overall network arrangement and topological organization. Finally, behavioural/system-level metrics (e.g., robustness, spectral radius, SVD complexity) capture emergent properties such as resilience, redundancy, and dynamic stability. This framework provides a transparent, ecologically interpretable mapping from species-level roles and interaction paths to system-level behaviour, facilitates identification of a Minimum Sufficient Set of descriptors, and links network structure to long-standing questions in the stability–complexity debate.</p>
