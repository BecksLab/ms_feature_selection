We argue that this apparent inconsistency arises not from methodological disagreement, but from a conceptual mismatch: network structure encodes multiple, hierarchically organised aspects of energy flow, each relating to different components of stability. Using a compilation of food webs from XXX, we quantified 31 commonly used structural metrics spanning species roles, interaction pathways, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour. We first used variable clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify dominant axes of structural variation and a non-redundant subset of descriptors. We then interpreted these axes through an energy-flow framework linking structural scale to distinct stability mechanisms: persistence (maintenance of energy flow following species loss), resistance (attenuation of perturbation propagation), and return (reorganisation of pathways following disturbance). Our analyses show that metrics often treated as competing predictors of 'stability' instead load onto different structural dimensions and relate to different stability components. Redundancy and species-role metrics primarily align with persistence, pathway and motif-based metrics with resistance, and global organisational measures with return dynamics. By explicitly mapping network structure to stability mechanisms, our results reconcile conflicting findings in the structure–stability literature and provide a principled framework for selecting network metrics based on ecological question and scale, rather than convention.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\n> Which metrics best represent the distinct stages of the energy-flow hierarchy, and do they capture different components of stability?\n\nEcological networks are commonly characterised using a large and diverse set of structural metrics, yet there remains little consensus on how these metrics should be interpreted or compared across studies (Vermaat et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2017). We argue that this difficulty arises because network structure is not a single property, but a hierarchy of interrelated components that encode different aspects of how energy moves through an ecosystem (Ulanowicz 1986; Thompson et al. 2012). Metrics derived at different structural scales therefore capture different ecological processes and, consequently, relate to different components of stability. Making these distinctions explicit is essential for interpreting patterns of structure–stability relationships.\n\n### Structural scale and the organisation of energy flow\n\nWe conceptualise food-web structure as organised across four hierarchical structural scales: node-level, path-level, network geometry, and emergent system behaviour (Pimm 1982; Cohen et al. 1990; Vermaat et al. 2009). These scales reflect increasing levels of integration, progressing from individual species roles to whole-network dynamics.\n\n**Node-level structure:** describes the properties and roles of individual species within the network. Metrics such as trophic position, basal and top species proportions, centrality, and trophic similarity capture how energy enters the system, which species process or redistribute that energy, and the degree of functional redundancy among taxa (Yodzis & Winemiller 1999; Estrada 2007; Allesina & Pascual 2009). At this scale, structure primarily reflects who participates in energy transfer and whether alternative species can compensate for local losses, a long-standing mechanism proposed to underpin persistence in complex ecosystems (McCann 2000).\n\n**Path-level structure**: describes how energy is routed through sequences of interactions linking species. Metrics such as food chain length, omnivory, motifs, loops, and prey–predator ratios capture the coupling of energy channels and the multiplicity of pathways connecting basal resources to higher trophic levels (Pimm & Lawton 1977; McCann et al. 1998; Stouffer & Bascompte 2011). This scale reflects how energy moves through the network and how perturbations may be transmitted across species, with particular pathway configurations either amplifying or diffusing disturbance effects (Neutel et al. 2002; Rooney et al. 2006).\n\n**Network geometry**: captures the global arrangement and constraints of interactions, including link density, connectance, clustering, modularity, intervality, and network distances (Dunne et al. 2002; Stouffer et al. 2006; Delmas et al. 2019). These properties define the overall “shape” of the food web and constrain which pathways are available for energy flow. Geometric organisation has been shown to influence the containment of perturbations, for example through compartmentalisation that limits the spread of local disturbances [@stoufferCompartmentalizationIncreasesFoodweb2011].\n\n**Emergent system-level behaviour**: reflects the collective dynamical properties that arise from the interaction of nodes, paths, and geometry. Metrics such as spectral radius, SVD complexity, and robustness capture properties that cannot be attributed to individual species or interactions alone, but instead describe the system’s overall capacity to absorb, reorganise, or amplify perturbations (May 1972; Staniczenko et al. 2013; Strydom et al. 2021).\n\nTogether, these structural scales form a causal hierarchy: species roles give rise to interaction pathways, which are embedded within a global network geometry, from which emergent dynamical behaviour arises.\n\n### Stability as a multi-component property\n\nStability is often treated as a single outcome, yet ecological theory has long recognised that it comprises multiple, distinct components (Pimm 1984; Ives & Carpenter 2007). Here, we focus on three complementary stability mechanisms that are directly interpretable in terms of energy flow: persistence, resistance, and return.\n\n**Persistence**: refers to the continued ability of the system to sustain energy flow following species loss or disturbance. Structures that promote redundancy, multiple basal inputs, and functional overlap among species enhance persistence by ensuring that energy can continue to enter and circulate within the network even when individual components are removed (McCann 2000; Dunne et al. 2002; Jonsson et al. 2015).\n\n**Resistance**: describes the extent to which perturbations are attenuated or contained rather than propagating through the network. Path-level structures such as omnivory, short chains, motifs, and modular organisation can diffuse or localise disturbances, reducing the likelihood that local perturbations escalate into system-wide effects (McCann et al. 1998; Neutel et al. 2002; Stouffer & Bascompte 2011).\n\n**Return**: captures the capacity of the system to reorganise or recover following disturbance, including the re-establishment of interaction pathways and the damping of oscillations. Emergent properties linked to global organisation and heterogeneity, such as spectral radius and structural complexity, reflect constraints on system-wide dynamics and influence the speed and manner with which a system returns to equilibrium or a new stable configuration (May 1972; Ulanowicz 2001; Staniczenko et al. 2013).\n\nCrucially, these stability components operate at different structural scales and are not expected to respond uniformly to the same network properties.\n\n### Implications for interpreting network metrics\n\nWithin this framework, metrics that are often treated as competing predictors of 'stability' instead emerge as complementary descriptors of different stability mechanisms [@thompsonFoodWebsReconciling2012]. Node-level metrics primarily relate to persistence, path-level metrics to resistance, and global organisational metrics to return dynamics. Some descriptors span multiple scales, reflecting the coupling between structural organisation and emergent behaviour (Allesina & Tang 2012).\n\nThis perspective provides a mechanistic explanation for why studies using different network metrics frequently report contrasting structure–stability relationships. Rather than reflecting inconsistency or redundancy, these differences arise because different metrics implicitly target different components of stability [@lauEcologicalNetworkMetrics2017]. By explicitly linking structural scale, energy flow, and stability mechanism, this framework provides a principled basis for interpreting network metrics and for selecting descriptors that align with specific ecological questions.\n\n| Structural scale | What it encodes | Energy-flow interpretation | Stability component |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Node | Species roles and redundancy | Who handles energy | Persistence (can energy still enter and move?) |\n| Path | Energy routing and coupling | How energy moves | Resistance (does disturbance spread?) |\n| Geometry | Network constraints and organisation | Where energy can go | Containment / buffering |\n| Behaviour | Emergent dynamics | How energy reorganizes | Return / reassembly |\n\n: Words\n\n# Materials & Methods\n\n## Data Compilation\n\nWe compiled quantitative network data from XX, resulting in a total of XX ecological networks. Each network was characterized using a suite of XX structural metrics [@tbl-properties], including classic descriptors such as richness, connectance, and modularity, as well as information-theoretic measures like spectral radius and SVD complexity. Prior to analysis, networks with missing values were omitted, and all metrics were standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1) to account for differences in scale and units across descriptors.\n\n| Label |

We use a combination of metrics from both the original @vermaatMajorDimensionsFoodweb2009 paper as well as including those that have been identified by @thompsonFoodWebsReconciling2012 and have been linked to emerging ecosystem properties such as stability {#tbl-properties}\n\n## Statistical Characterisation of Network Space\n\nTo identify the dominant axes of structural variation within our dataset, we expanded upon the dimensionality reduction approach established by Vermaat et al. (2009). We quantified 31 structural metrics for each food web, categorising them into four hierarchical scales of energy flow: Node-level (e.g., trophic roles), Path-level (e.g., energy sequences), Network Geometry (e.g., global shape), and Emergent Behaviour (e.g., system-wide complexity).\n\n### Dimensionality Reduction and Metric Selection\n\nTo identify a non-redundant subset of structural descriptors, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the scaled structural metrics. We excluded stability-related outcomes (*e.g.,* robustness, ρ, and SVD complexity) from the PCA to ensure the resulting dimensions represented pure physical architecture.\n\nWe determined the number of significant structural dimensions using Kaiser’s Criterion (eigenvalues >1) and an analysis of the scree plot 'elbow'. To select a representative anchor for each significant dimension, we programmatically identified the metric with the highest contribution percentage (cos^2) to each Principal Component (PC). In cases where a single metric dominated multiple dimensions, the next highest unique contributor was selected to ensure a parsimonious yet comprehensive subset of predictors.\n\n## Linking Structure to Stability Components\n\nTo test the hypothesis that different hierarchical structural scales govern distinct aspects of ecological stability, we employed Random Forest (RF) models. We defined three response variables representing components of Stability:\n\n* Persistence: Quantified as structural Robustness (secondary extinction resistance).\n* Dampening: Quantified as the Spectral Radius (ρ), representing local stability.\n* Organization: Quantified as SVD Complexity, representing the informational diversity of energy channels.\n\n### Model Specification and Importance\n\nEach stability component was modelled as a function of the six 'Structural Pillars' identified in the PCA phase (S1, Richness, PredPreyRatio, Distance, Herbivory, and MaxSim). We used 1,000 trees per forest to ensure stable importance estimates. We quantified the relative influence of each structural pillar using Percentage Increase in Mean Squared Error (%IncMSE), which identifies the metrics most indispensable for model accuracy.\n\n### Directional Effects\n\nTo interpret the ecological nature of these relationships, we generated Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs). These plots visualize the marginal effect of a winning structural pillar on its associated stability component while accounting for the average effects of all other predictors.\n\n## Validation of Structural Modularity\n\nTo assess the redundancy and independence of the 31 structural metrics, we performed a Hierarchical Variable Clustering analysis using the hclust algorithm in R. We used 1−∣Correlation∣ as the distance metric to group variables based on the strength of their relationship, regardless of the direction of the correlation.\n\nTo determine the optimal number of structural modules, we calculated Average Silhouette Widths for k=2 to 10. Additionally, we performed multiscale bootstrap resampling (n=1000) using the pvclust package to assign Approximately Unbiased (AU) p-values to each cluster, ensuring that the identified modules were statistically robust and not artifacts of the specific dataset.\n\n# Results\n\n## The Six Dimensions of Food Web Architecture\n\nThe PCA revealed a high-dimensional structural space where the first six principal components accounted for 84.9% of the total structural variation (Table 1). This indicates that while food web structure is complex, it can be effectively distilled into six primary axes of architectural variation.\n\n* Dimension 1 (31.6% variance) was anchored by S1 (the number of pathways from basal species), representing the total volume of energy entry points.\n* Dimension 2 (21.6% variance) was dominated by Richness (S), representing the overall scale of the network.\n* Dimension 3 (15.5% variance) was defined by the Predator-Prey Ratio, capturing the balance of trophic roles (Node-level).\n* Dimension 4 (6.8% variance) was driven by Mean Distance, reflecting the efficiency or tightness of the wiring (Path-level).\n* Dimension 5 (5.2% variance) was anchored by Herbivory, identifying the functional dominance of specific energy channels.\n* Dimension 6 (4.4% variance) was represented by MaxSim (Maximum Similarity), a measure of trophic redundancy and functional overlap.\n\n## Alignment with the Energy-Flow Hierarchy\n\nThe distribution of these representative metrics across the PCA dimensions suggests that no single hierarchical scale dominates food-web variation. Instead, the network space is composed of a mixture of Path-level (S1, Distance), Geometry (Richness), and Node-level (PredPreyRatio, Herbivory, MaxSim) properties. Notably, S1 (a Path-level metric) explained more variance than Richness, suggesting that the arrangement of energy flow pathways is a more fundamental structural signature than simple species counts.\n\n### Differential Drivers of Ecological Stability\n\nThe Random Forest models revealed a clear partitioning of structural influence, with different 'pillars' emerging as the dominant predictors for each stability component (Table 2).\n\nPersistence (Robustness) was primarily governed by PredPreyRatio (%IncMSE = 15.98) and Herbivory (%IncMSE = 10.23). Surprisingly, network Richness had no predictive power for persistence (%IncMSE = -2.49), suggesting that the balance of trophic roles is more critical for preventing extinction cascades than the total number of species.\n\nDampening (ρ) was most sensitive to Herbivory (%IncMSE = 17.28). This indicates that the strength and proportion of energy flow originating from the basal-consumer interface is the primary regulator of a network's local stability.\n\nOrganization (SVD Complexity) was uniquely driven by MaxSim (%IncMSE = 13.12) and S1 (%IncMSE = 12.56). This supports the view that informational complexity emerges from a combination of unique species roles (low similarity) and the total volume of energy entry pathways.\n\n### Directionality and Trophic Control\n\nPartial dependence analysis provided a mechanistic look at how these pillars operate:\n\nTrophic Balance: Persistence showed a [direction] response to the PredPreyRatio, indicating an optimal balance between consumers and resources is required to maintain structural integrity.\n\nBasal Channels: The system's ability to dampen perturbations (ρ) improved as Herbivory [increased/decreased], suggesting that basal-heavy webs act as a buffer for energy surges.\n\nSpecialization: SVD Complexity increased as MaxSim decreased, confirming that organised networks are those where species occupy distinct, non-overlapping trophic niches rather than redundant ones.\n\nOur multi-stage analysis reveals that food web stability is governed by a hierarchical architecture where structural modules serve as specialized functional levers. While Principal Component Analysis and Silhouette validation (k=10) confirm the high dimensionality of network space, the hierarchical clustering identifies four robust, independent modules (AU ≥ 0.94) that dictate system behaviour. We find a clear decoupling of network scale from network persistence; specifically, the Geometric Scale module (containing Richness and Connectance) accounts for significant structural variance but fails to predict any component of stability. Instead, the Energy Flow Engine (Module 3) and Trophic Redundancy (Module 4) emerge as the primary controllers. Specifically, node-level balance within the flow engine (PredPreyRatio and Herbivory) determines persistence and dampening, while the isolation of species roles (MaxSim) dictates organizational complexity. This suggests that the stability of an ecosystem is not a product of its size, but of the specific configuration of its energy channels and the redundancy of its functional roles.\n\n-   Redundancy / persistence\n-   Pathway coupling / resistance\n-   Organizational constraint / return\n-   Reduced metric sets retain these axes\n\n# Discussion\n\n## Why consensus on “the best metric” has remained elusive\n\nFor more than four decades, the structure–stability debate has oscillated between competing structural descriptors, from connectance and complexity to modularity, omnivory, and trophic redundancy. Early theoretical work, most notably by May, suggested that increasing complexity should destabilise large systems, placing global descriptors such as connectance and interaction density at the centre of the debate. Subsequent empirical and theoretical studies, however, demonstrated stabilising roles for omnivory, weak links, and compartmentalisation (e.g. McCann; Dunne), shifting attention toward pathway-level and geometric properties. Our results suggest that this apparent inconsistency does not arise because some metrics are “wrong,” but because they capture different dimensions of a fundamentally multi-layered architecture. Food-web structure is not a single axis ranging from simple to complex; it is a high-dimensional space in which node composition, pathway routing, geometric constraint, and emergent organisation vary semi-independently. Metrics that have historically been treated as competitors—such as richness, connectance, omnivory, and redundancy—are in fact anchors of distinct structural dimensions. This explains why no single metric consistently predicts “stability” across studies: stability itself is not singular. When studies measure persistence (e.g. secondary extinctions), node-level balance and redundancy dominate. When they measure local stability or damping, path-level coupling and basal channel dominance matter more. When they measure recovery or informational organisation, global heterogeneity and role differentiation become decisive. The search for a universal structural predictor of stability has therefore been misguided—not because structure is unimportant, but because both structure and stability are multidimensional.\n\n## Reconciling contrasting structure–stability relationships\n\nA persistent challenge in the literature has been that similar metrics sometimes show opposite associations with stability. For example, omnivory has been reported as stabilising in some contexts and destabilising in others. Within our framework, this variability is expected. Path-level coupling (e.g. omnivory motifs) primarily relates to resistance—the containment or diffusion of perturbations—rather than persistence per se. A structure that dampens oscillations may not prevent extinction cascades, and vice versa. Similarly, our finding that richness contributes substantially to structural variance but fails to predict any stability component underscores an important decoupling: network size is not synonymous with robustness. This result aligns with empirical syntheses showing that species richness alone poorly predicts secondary extinction resistance unless accompanied by trophic balance or redundancy. In our analyses, the predator–prey ratio and herbivory—metrics reflecting trophic shape and basal channel dominance—were far stronger determinants of persistence and damping than richness itself. This helps reconcile why biodiversity–stability studies sometimes find positive, neutral, or context-dependent relationships. Richness operates primarily as a geometric scaling variable. Its effect on stability depends on how additional species alter the configuration of energy channels—whether they add redundancy, elongate chains, skew trophic balance, or increase coupling. Without specifying which structural dimension richness modifies, its stability effect is indeterminate.\n\n## Implications for biodiversity–stability theory\n\nOur results contribute to a long-standing tension between the “complexity begets instability” argument and more recent views that diversity enhances resilience. The resolution lies in recognising that different dimensions of complexity influence different stability components. Redundancy and trophic similarity (low MaxSim heterogeneity) enhance persistence by providing functional compensation following species loss. Pathway multiplicity and basal channel dominance regulate resistance by shaping how perturbations propagate. Global organisational heterogeneity (captured by SVD complexity and spectral properties) influences return dynamics by constraining system-wide oscillations and reassembly patterns. In this sense, complexity is neither inherently stabilising nor destabilising. Instead, distinct forms of complexity map onto distinct dynamical outcomes. Connectance, motif structure, redundancy, and informational heterogeneity are not interchangeable proxies for “complexity,” but structurally and mechanistically distinct attributes. By explicitly embedding food-web metrics within an energy-flow hierarchy, our framework reframes biodiversity–stability theory. Stability emerges not from species number alone, but from the configuration of energy channels and the distribution of functional roles across those channels. A bottom-heavy web with balanced predator–prey ratios and differentiated trophic niches may achieve both persistence and damping, even at moderate richness. Conversely, a species-rich but top-heavy or weakly differentiated web may remain fragile.\n\n## Structural modularity and the minimum sufficient set\n\nA key practical outcome of our analysis is the identification of six structural pillars that capture nearly 85% of the variation in network architecture. Despite starting with 31 commonly used metrics, much of their variance collapses into a smaller number of independent axes. Hierarchical clustering further revealed robust modules corresponding to trophic balance, pathway structure, geometric scale, and redundancy. This dimensional reduction has two important implications. First, it demonstrates that many commonly reported metrics are statistically redundant. Reporting both connectance and L/S, or multiple correlated distance measures, adds little new information. Second, it provides a principled route toward a minimum sufficient descriptor set tailored to ecological questions. Rather than selecting metrics by convention, researchers can select representatives of the relevant structural scale.\n\n## Guidance for metric choice based on ecological question\n\nIf the question concerns extinction cascades or tolerance to species loss (persistence): prioritise node-level balance and redundancy metrics (e.g. predator–prey ratio, herbivory, similarity). If the question concerns perturbation propagation or damping (resistance): focus on path-level and basal-channel metrics (e.g. pathway multiplicity, omnivory, mean distance). If the question concerns recovery dynamics or organisational reassembly (return): emphasise global heterogeneity and spectral measures (e.g. SVD complexity, spectral radius). If the question concerns comparative architecture across systems: use geometric anchors (e.g. richness) but interpret them as scale descriptors rather than stability predictors. This scale-explicit approach shifts the emphasis from asking “Which metric best predicts stability?” to “Which structural dimension corresponds to the stability mechanism of interest?”\n\n## Limitations and future directions\n\nWhile our framework clarifies structural dimensionality, it remains grounded in static network topology. Real ecosystems exhibit interaction strengths, temporal variability, adaptive rewiring, and environmental forcing. Incorporating weighted networks and dynamic simulations would strengthen the mechanistic link between structural axes and realised dynamics. Additionally, the separation of persistence, resistance, and return is analytically useful but biologically intertwined. For example, structures that enhance resistance may indirectly support persistence by preventing large cascades. Future work could explore how these components interact across environmental gradients and disturbance regimes. Finally, extending this framework beyond trophic networks to mutualistic, host–parasite, or multilayer networks would test its generality. The energy-flow hierarchy proposed here may represent a broader organising principle of ecological interaction systems.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nFood-web stability is not governed by a single structural property, but by multiple, hierarchically organised dimensions of network architecture. Node composition, pathway routing, geometric constraint, and emergent organisation each represent distinct levers through which ecosystems maintain persistence, resist perturbation, and reorganise following disturbance.\n\nBy explicitly mapping structural scale to stability mechanism, we reconcile decades of seemingly conflicting findings in the structure–stability literature. The key insight is not that one metric is superior, but that different metrics answer different ecological questions. Recognising and embracing this multidimensionality provides a coherent foundation for future biodiversity–stability research and a practical framework for selecting network descriptors based on mechanism rather than tradition.\n\n| Dimension | Key Metrics | Expected Effect on Stability | Supporting Literature |\n|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Complexity & Redundancy | Connectance, MaxSim, Links | **Positive:** High redundancy allows for 'functional compensation' if one species is lost. | @dunneFoodwebStructureNetwork2002; @mccannDiversityStabilityDebate2000 |\n| Compartmentalization | Clust, Modularity, ρ | **Positive:** Limits the spread of perturbations; local collapses don't become global. | @stoufferCompartmentalizationIncreasesFoodweb2011 |\n| Feedback & Coupling | Omnivory (S2), Loop, ChLen | **Variable:** Omnivory can stabilize by diffusing energy, but long chains can amplify oscillations. | @mccannDiversityStabilityDebate2000; @neutelStabilityRealFood2002 |\n| Hierarchy & Shape | Prey:Predator, Basal, Top | **Critical:** 'Bottom-heavy' systems are generally more stable; inverted pyramids are fragile. |  |\n| Information Heterogeneity | SVD Complexity, LinkSD | **Positive:** Diverse interaction strengths prevent 'resonant' instabilities. | @ulanowiczInformationTheoryEcology2001 |\n\n: Network properties used for analysis. {#tbl-metrics}\n\nTo better link network structure to ecosystem function, we grouped commonly used food web metrics into four functional categories reflecting their ecological interpretation. Node-level metrics (e.g., basal, top, intermediate, herbivory, cannibal, trophic level, centrality, MaxSim) capture the roles and properties of individual species. Path-level metrics (*e.g.,* food chain lengths, motifs, omnivory, loops, prey-to-predator ratios) describe how energy and interactions flow through the network. Geometry metrics (e.g., connectance, link density, clustering, variation in links, diameter, intervality, spectral radius, SVD complexity) quantify the overall network arrangement and topological organization. Finally, behavioural/system-level metrics (e.g., robustness, spectral radius, SVD complexity) capture emergent properties such as resilience, redundancy, and dynamic stability. This framework provides a transparent, ecologically interpretable mapping from species-level roles and interaction paths to system-level behaviour, facilitates identification of a Minimum Sufficient Set of descriptors, and links network structure to long-standing questions in the stability–complexity debate.\n\n| Category | Metrics | Rationale |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Node-level | basal, top, intermediate, herbivory, cannibal, TL, centrality, MaxSim | Metrics describing individual species and their roles in the network, including trophic position (TL), feeding type (basal, herbivory, cannibal), influence (centrality), and functional redundancy (MaxSim). |\n| Path level | ChLen, ChSD, ChNum, path, S1, S2, S4, S5, omnivory, loops, predpreyRatio, distance | Metrics describing energy flow or interaction paths through the network, including food chain lengths, motifs, omnivory, loops, and prey-predator ratios.
